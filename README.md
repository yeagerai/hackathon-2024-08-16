# YeagerAI GenLayer Simulator Hackathon
### Date: August 16, 2024

## Overview
The YeagerAI Hackathon was an exciting opportunity for teams to test and develop new use cases using the GenLayer Simulator. Held on August 16, 2024, the event encouraged creativity and innovation among participants, leading to a series of intelligent contract developments that may serve as future examples for developers.

## Event Details
### Objectives
- **Explore and Develop:** Teams were tasked with creating interesting use cases for GenLayer's capabilities.
- **Feedback and Improvement:** Participants provided insights on the Simulator and GenLayer documentation to enhance usability and functionality.
- **Team Building:** The event served as a platform for colleagues to interact in a fun and engaging environment.

### Format
- The hackathon was conducted over a single day, where teams worked remotely, considering various time zones.
- Documentation and support were provided via the GenLayer's Simulator official documentation.
- Final presentations were held at the end of the day, with teams showcasing their use cases and the community voting on the most innovative solutions.

### Teams and Contributions
Here are the teams that participated in the Hackathon, along with the highlights of their proposed use cases:

- [**Deep Thought Coders:**](./DeepThoughtCoders/) [Denis, JM] The "ADRValidator" is a GenLayer-powered tool that automates and ensures trustless validation of architectural decision records, categorizing them and checking for consistency across projects, and features a token-based reward system to incentivize quality contributions in shared resource decision-making contexts.
- [**Don't Panic Developers:**](./dont-panic-developers/) [Jose Ignacio, Araceli] "Roko's Mansion Game" is a text-based adventure game featuring dynamic content and puzzle-solving, managed through a contract that uses a language model for generating in-game text and actions, and includes an ERC721 NFT system to award players upon game completion.
- [**Infinite Improbability Engineers:**](./) [Jeff, Khush] This intelligent contract on the GenLayer blockchain allows passengers to buy insurance for their flights, ensuring they are automatically compensated if their flights are delayed, without needing to trust the insurance manager for payment.
- [**Sirius Cybernetics:**](./Sirius-Cybernetics/) [Raf, Bulat] "On-chain-verifier" for verifying identities using social media. And a "P2P-commit-reveal"  privacy-focused contract enabling two parties to make agreements or bets without prematurely revealing their choices. Plus a "Multi-modal-image-processing" to perform image processing tasks such as resizing and color adjustments enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on centralized servers.
- [**The Digital Dolphins:**](./) [Toni, Edgars] The "Constitutional DAO" is a decentralized autonomous organization on the GenLayer blockchain that uses intelligent contracts for adaptable, AI-driven governance, merging on-chain constitutional compliance with flexible decision-making processes, and offering distinct structured and purely language model-based governance approaches.
- [**The Towel Techies:**](./TowelTechies/) [Agustin, Navi] The "Social Sentiment Trading dApp" is a decentralized application that leverages sentiment analysis to generate trading signals based on tweets from influential crypto personalities. 
- [**Vagon Constructors:**](./vagon-constructors/) [Kira, Cristiam] The "GitHub Bounties" contract is designed to financially reward developers for contributing to open source projects by merging pull requests that address and close specific issues.

### Results
The hackathon concluded with presentations from all teams, and votes were cast to determine the most innovative use case. 

**The winner was Infinite Improbability Engineers! Congrats to the team!**

### Feedback
Participants were encouraged to provide feedback on the Simulator and GenLayer documentation throughout the event to foster continuous improvement.

## Future Events
YeagerAI plans to host more such events in the future, aiming to further harness the creative potential of its community and push the boundaries of what can be achieved with GenLayer technology.
