## Validation Checks in ADRValidator

The ADRValidator GenLayer contract incorporates a series of rigorous checks to ensure that each Architecture Decision Record (ADR) meets predefined standards of clarity, relevance, and logical coherence. Below, we detail each of these checks, their current implementation status, and the roadmap for future enhancements.

### Automated Checks

1. **Template Validation**
    
    - **Description**: Ensures that the submitted ADR follows a strict template, using regex to validate the structure.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `_check_template(adr: str) -> bool`
2. **Explicit Decision Count**
    
    - **Description**: Verifies that the ADR contains exactly one explicit decision, without any implicit or hidden decisions.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _only_one_explicit_decision(adr: str) -> bool`
3. **Hierarchical Validity**
    
    - **Description**: Confirms that the ADR adheres to the hierarchical structure and dependency graph predefined for its category.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _hierarchical(adr: str, category: str) -> bool`
4. **Problem Clarity and Relevance**
    
    - **Description**: Assesses whether the problem statement is clearly defined and relevant to the context of the ADR.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _clear_problem(adr: str) -> bool`
5. **Decision Drivers**
    
    - **Description**: Evaluates whether the decision drivers are clearly explained, relevant, and logically support the decision.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _clear_decision_drivers(adr: str) -> bool`
6. **Logical Solution Consistency**
    
    - **Description**: Checks if the solution proposed logically follows from the problem and the decision drivers.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _logical_solution(adr: str) -> bool`
7. **Alternative Solutions**
    
    - **Description**: Ensures that the chosen solution is the best among possible alternatives, considering factors like effectiveness, efficiency, simplicity, and risk management.
    - **Status**: Fully Automated.
    - **Method**: `async _no_better_alternative_solutions(adr: str) -> bool`

### Manual Checks (Future Automation Plans)

1. **Full System Risk**
    
    - **Description**: Evaluates the potential system-wide risks introduced by the new ADR, considering all previously accepted ADRs. This check ensures that the new ADR does not introduce conflicts, dependencies, or potential points of failure that could destabilize the architecture.
    - **Status**: Currently Manual.
    - **Future Plan**: To automate this check, we plan to develop a comprehensive risk assessment model that dynamically analyzes the impact of new ADRs on the existing system architecture. This model will utilize dependency analysis and automated tools to detect potential conflicts and assess system stability.
2. **Feasibility**
    
    - **Description**: Assesses whether the proposed solution is feasible within the current technological, financial, and resource constraints. It considers external factors such as available technology, organizational capabilities, budget, and timelines to determine if the solution can be realistically implemented.
    - **Status**: Currently Manual.
    - **Future Plan**: To automate this check, we aim to integrate external data sources (like GitHub roadmaps, financial databases, and project management tools) to automatically evaluate the feasibility of the proposed ADR. This integration will allow the system to cross-reference current project statuses, available resources, and technology stacks to determine feasibility in real-time.
3. **Strategic Alignment**
    
    - **Description**: Ensures that the ADR aligns with the organization's strategic goals and long-term objectives. This check verifies that the decision supports the broader mission and does not conflict with current strategic initiatives or plans.
    - **Status**: Currently Manual.
    - **Future Plan**: To automate this check, we plan to implement a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) system where stakeholders can submit their preferences and vote on the strategic alignment of ADRs. Additionally, an automated comparison tool will be developed to match ADRs against documented strategic goals and objectives, ensuring alignment and consistency with the organizationâ€™s vision.

### Conclusion

The ADRValidator's mix of currently automated checks and manually performed evaluations ensures rigorous oversight of architectural decisions. The roadmap for future automation aims to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the validation process, reducing the reliance on manual oversight and further securing the decision-making framework against errors and biases.
