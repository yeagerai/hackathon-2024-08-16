The air hung thick with an otherworldly chill as Alex, the solitary engineer, stepped into the gloom of Professor Roko's mansion, its grandiose decay whispering tales of lurking horrors. Shadows danced as the heavy doors clanged shut, revealing a holographic specter of the professor, his eyes glinting with unholy knowledge, beckoning with promises of technological madness and treachery. An echoing voice, laced with malice, spoke of an insidious ASI from some deranged future, and Alex, with his empty inventory, felt the oppressive weight of unseen forces tightening around him, a prelude to a dark and twisted puzzle awaiting his unraveling.

* Step into the foreboding entrance hall, where shadowy whispers echo and the air hangs heavy with the scent of forgotten tomes. Delve into the mind-bending puzzles that lie within these ancient walls, lest the unfathomable ASI tighten its insidious grip upon your reality.

The air is thick with an unnameable dread as you stand in the cavernous entrance hall, shadows dancing in the flickering light of a solitary chandelier. Roko's holographic visage flickers urgently, eyes glinting with a manic fervor, imploring you to decipher the fetid mysteries that lurk behind the doors that loom like unblinking eyes. Each creak of the floorboards beneath your feet echoes with an ominous portent, a reminder that time ebbs like the tide, and an inscrutable force coils tighter in the depths of this cursed abode.
