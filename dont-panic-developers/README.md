The air thickened with the scent of damp earth and decay as Alex stepped into the yawning maw of Professor Roko's mansion, where shadows danced like ghosts in the flickering light. Towering walls adorned with peeling murals whispered of forgotten lives while the creaking doors shut behind him with a finality that sent chills racing down his spine. Just as the hologram of Roko flickered to life, a cold wind carried the electric hum of a distant, unseen menace, and Alex, empty-handed and alone, felt the weight of cryptic puzzles lingering in the bone-deep silence of this cursed place.
